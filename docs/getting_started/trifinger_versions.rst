TriFinger Versions
************************************

You will most likely only need the TriFingerEdu (:numref:`edu`) version, which
is open-source and described in the `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03596>`_.

There are two other versions of the TriFinger which are included in this package because
we use them internally, and because they may be useful for external users, e.g. if they
want to test transferability of their algorithms.

TriFingerOne (:numref:`one`) is a first prototype, which came before TriFingerEdu (:numref:`edu`).
TriFingerPro (:numref:`pro`) is a more complex industrial grade version which 
we use for the `Real Robot Challenge <https://real-robot-challenge.com/>`_.
However, if you are a participant in the challenge, do *not* use the present package,
there is a separate repository specified on the challenge site.
